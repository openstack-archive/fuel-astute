    # As I (Andrey Danin) understand, Puppet agent goes through these steps:
    #   * Puppetd has 'stopped' state.
    #   * We run it as a run_once, and puppetd goes to 'idling' state - it trying to
    #       retrieve catalog.
    #   * If it can't retrieve catalog, it goes back to 'stopped' state without
    #       any update of last_run_summary file.
    #   * If puppetd retrieve catalog, it goes to 'running' state, which means
    #       it appying catalog to system.
    #   * When puppetd finished catalog run, it updates last_run_summary file
    #       but stays in 'running' state for a while.
    #   * After puppetd finished all internal jobs connected with finished catalog,
    #       it goes to 'idling' state.
    #   * After a short time it goes to 'stopped' state because we ran it as a run_once.
